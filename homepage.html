          <p style="margin: 40px; ">Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. 
            Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect 
            it has on their own lives. Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be reduced by tax or administrative 
            costs, preventing the full amount from reaching the people or causes they really want to help. Thankfully there are ways to
             make the most of every donation to charity. Your own charitable donations can inspire your nearest and dearest to give to 
             causes important to them, and could even bring about a family-wide effort to back a charity or charities that have special 
             significance to you as a group. Family giving creates a bond, helping to bolster relationships through a shared goal and 
             raising more money than could otherwise be possible through individual donations. Chances are, many of your family members 
             are already giving to charity, so working together could help you to make even more of a positive impact. We can help you 
             family to set up a family CAF Charitable Trust to make coordinating your donations simple and sustainable.</p>
